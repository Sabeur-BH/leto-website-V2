          <ul>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Brand name:</strong> <em>— Leto</em>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              We chose the name Leto, because it is short, easy to remember and sounds smooth and feminine. It refers to the ancient god names Leto, who is the goddess of motherhood, which also align with our brand vision and mission.  
            </li>
		    </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                 <strong> Brand Logo: </strong>
                 <ul class="list-unstyled">
                   <li> Our goal was to create a logo that is not too literal, but rather abstract with minimalist shapes and a single colour that complements the calming and modern feel we are aiming for with the brand. We wanted the logo to symbolize the key values of our brand, which are harmony and balance. To achieve this, we opted for simple shapes that would create a sense of balance without being symmetrical. The logo reflects the idea that mothers need to find a way to be there for their child while also taking care of themselves. This duality is a recurring theme in our brand, and we wanted it to be reflected in our logo as well. </li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
			
          <h6>Colour schemes&nbsp;</h6>
          <ul>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Primary colour #1:</strong> <em>— #5E70A2-</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
				<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color:#5E70A2;"></span>
              Our first primary colour is a deep, muted shade of blue commonly referred to as "steel blue". This particular shade is often associated with qualities such as professionalism, efficiency, and reliability. We chose this colour because it is not as harsh as other shades of blue and has a touch of purple, which is commonly associated with women and gives off a sense of calmness and stability.  
            </li>
		    </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                 <strong> Primary colour #2:</strong> <em>— #F2CC8F-</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
				<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color:#F2CC8F"></span>
              To create contrast we chose a bit more friendly and positive colour to match with the steel blue. This shade of light, muted yellow often associated with warmth, and positivity.  Additionally, blue’s complementary colour is yellow, so they create a pleasing visual effect.   
            </li>
		    </ul>
            </li>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Primary colour #3</strong>: <em>— #FFFFFF-</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
				<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color:#FFFFFF"></span>
              Having white in our colour palette might seem a bit strange and boring but we understand that it's necessary to create balance and harmony between our two primary colours, which have a lot of contrast. By adding white as a neutral colour, we can achieve this goal. Additionally, we have learned that many luxury brands use white in their branding, and this could be an effective strategy for Leto to position itself better in the market.   
            </li>
		    </ul>
            </li>
			
			   <li>
                 <strong> Secondary colour #4:</strong> <em>— #717275-</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
				<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color:#717275"></span>
              Leto's website is heavily focused on maintaining consistency, which we achieved by dominantly using our three primary colours. We chose this specific shade of grey that has a cool and muted tone, which can be perceived as elegant and modern. This shade is dominantly used for our typefaces because it's easy to read.    
            </li>

          <h6>Font choices&nbsp;</h6>
          <ul>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Logo: </strong><em>— Goldoni</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              Goldoni is a serif font that is often used in luxury branding, and it is a suitable choice for a logo. It’s elegant and sophisticated design creates a timeless and refined look that can enhance a brand's image. Its delicate curves and lines can convey a sense of luxury and exclusivity that aligns with a high-end brand's values.  
            </li>
		    </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                 <strong> Headlines and paragraphs:</strong> <em>— DM Sans</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              For the headlines and paragraphs, we use the DM Sans family of fonts. This font has a clean and clear design with well-defined letterforms that make it easy to read on digital screens. Since there are many visual elements on the website, we wanted to balance it with a simpler typeface. The contemporary and modern design of DM Sans gives the website a fresh and up-to-date look, while its minimalist and clean design conveys a sense of professionalism and sophistication. To create hierarchy, we use various font weights to showcase headlines and paragraphs.    
            </li>

            </li>

                <strong> Graphics </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> We make use of one specific shape on the website, which reoccurs many times, and which helps to build a comprehensive look to all the pages. This wavey shape also match with the feeling of Leto, calm and smooth. The logo has curvy elements, this is why we ended up using the same curvy path to this visual as well. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                 <strong> Animations </strong>
                 <ul class="list-unstyled">
                   <li> In order to enhance the user experience, we utilized little animations to promote our brand values. Our landing page features an animated headline that dynamically showcases the three values of Leto in a visually appealing and memorable way. Moreover, we added small interactive animations to each value in the "Values" to encourage user engagement. </li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Icons </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> To ensure that Leto's style remains consistent, and that the information presented is user-friendly and easily understandable, we created a unique set of icons. These icons not only help to break up lengthy text blocks, but they also make the website more organized and visually attractive. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <strong> Navbar </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> The navigation bar is designed with clear labels that are easy to understand, using sans-serif typeface with a high contrast against the background, which enhances readability. It is placed in a standard position at the top of the page, using a fixed position, making it easily accessible and consistent throughout the website. The bar incorporates interactive elements that enhance user feedback, with a hover effect on the active page, which provides clear feedback to the user.  </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                 <strong> Buttons </strong>
                 <ul class="list-unstyled">
                   <li> The website's buttons are designed to align with Leto's colour scheme. When a user hovers over a button, the colour of the button changes, providing clear feedback to the user that it is a clickable element.  </li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Cards </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> The website utilizes a card design pattern throughout, creating a consistent visual theme. These cards serve to chunk information, making it more easily readable and digestible for the user.   </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                <strong> Dropdown </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> In desktop mode, the website features a dropdown menu in the navigation bar that allows users to choose between viewing information about the team or the brand. This was implemented based on feedback from prototype testing, where users found the previous navigation structure too broad. In smaller screens, the entire navigation bar becomes a dropdown menu, creating a less crowded and more streamlined mobile experience.  </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Checkboxes </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> We used the checkbox design pattern in the crowdfunding section, which is an effective way to encourage donations. By presenting preselected amounts, it's easy for users to choose how much they want to donate without having to type in an amount. This simplifies the process and eliminates the need for users to decide on their own donation amount.   </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> The crowdfunding section includes a progress bar that displays the amount of money that has already been donated to Leto. This feature helps to build trust in the brand by demonstrating that others have contributed to the cause. Additionally, it provides a visual representation of how close Leto is to reaching its fundraising goal.  </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <strong> Form </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> The donation form is designed to be user-friendly and straightforward. We aimed to simplify the process as much as possible because we understand that this is a crucial moment where users may choose to abandon the site if the form is too lengthy or complicated to fill out.   </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <strong> Structure:</strong>
                 <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              Our initial plan was to create a parallax website with a single page, where users could navigate using either scrolling or with the navigation bar. We opted for a one-pager design to focus the user's attention on a single topic and enhance their mobile experience by eliminating the need to click on links or tabs. However, we later decided to move the fundraising section to a separate page to avoid coming across as overly pushy in soliciting donations, which wouldn't align with Leto's premium brand image.  

              In our first prototype, the order of the content was assembled differently. After our landing page we had our vision and mission plus value statements, and then the description of our service. We decided to change that since it was confusing to the user, and It didn’t make sense to ask for support at the beginning without showing the service we are raising for.   
            </li>
		   </ul>
          </li>
       </ul>
			
			<h6>Content&nbsp;</h6>
          <ul>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Landing page/ Hero section  </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> The homepage features a striking hero image that immediately captures the user's attention and sets the tone for the rest of the site. The animated header adds a touch of sophistication without being too overwhelming, as we wanted to maintain a calm and modern atmosphere that reflects Leto's high-end image. A video component would have been inappropriate for this design approach. 

				  A call-to-action button is also implemented in the landing page, which is clearly communicate the purpose of the page, helps the user to navigate easier on the website and encourage the user to support the brand.    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                 <strong> Our service </strong>
                 <ul class="list-unstyled">
                   <li> We implemented a 3-column grid system to organize information of our service. These grids are particularly effective at maintaining clarity and organization, especially when the information is long and a bit more complex Additionally, the grid system adds a sense of consistency to the website's appearance, as it is applied consistently throughout the site.  website. 

					The use of pictures in combination with the service description enhances user engagement and makes the information more digestible.  When the user hovers over an image, the zoom effect draws their attention and encourages them to interact with the content. The interactive nature of this effect helps to make the website feel more dynamic and interesting, which can improve user satisfaction and increase the time spent on the 

					Following the brief descriptions, a button is included for users who wish to access further information. This design choice allows this section to function as a teaser, arousing the user's curiosity and encouraging them to learn more. By clicking the button, users can delve deeper into the content and even contribute to Leto by donating.   </li>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> To emphasize the essence of Leto, we employed the same shape as we discussed in supporting visuals in a different manner. Our layout features two complementary columns, which symbolize balance and harmony, imparting a clear understanding of Leto's core vision and mission.  </li>
                </ul>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> In this section, we utilized the 3-grid system once again to present a larger amount of text. To make the content more visually appealing and interactive for users, we combined the grid system with icons and little animations. This approach created a more engaging user experience and helped to convey the information in an effective and memorable way.   </li>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> This section serves two important purposes. Firstly, encouraging users to subscribe to the newsletter is an effective way to establish and maintain a positive relationship with customers. Secondly, from a visual standpoint, this section plays a crucial role in breaking up the vibrant coloured backgrounds and graphic elements by incorporating a photograph. This design choice ensures that the overall aesthetic remains visually appealing and doesn't become overwhelming to the eyes.  </li>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> The final section is dedicated to showcasing the team behind Leto. This approach is effective in establishing a personal connection between the brand and the users, as it provides insight into who we are as a team. However, we opted to place this section at the end of the website, as we believe that it is not the most critical element that we want to emphasize to users.   </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                <strong> Support us Page </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> The most critical page of the website is the crowdfunding section, as it serves the purpose of raising money. However, it was important to maintain Leto's style consistency while presenting this section, as we didn't want to be too pushy. The initial part of the page provides information about the service, as we believe that it is essential to be transparent about why we are asking for donations. The crowdfunding box follows, which includes preselected amounts with checkboxes to simplify the donation process, as previously discussed. The progress bar and donation form have also been discussed in the UI element section. We added a pop-up window to the website that appears when the user fills out the donation form and clicks on the submit button. This pop-up serves as a feedback confirmation to the user that their donation was successful and was received by Leto. 

Finally, at the bottom of the page, there is a graphical element of a bus that says, "Leto is coming soon," which is a friendly visual representation of the campaign's progress that aligns with Leto's style guidelines.    </li>
                </ul>

          <h6>Band Identity&nbsp;</h6>
          <ul>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Brand name:</strong> <em>— Leto</em>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              Our brand name is Leto, which we picked because it is short, easy to remember and has a smooth and feminine sound. The name is inspired by the ancient goddess Leto, who was the goddess of motherhood. This aligns with our brand's vision and mission.&nbsp; </li>
		    </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                 <strong> Brand Logo: </strong>
                 <ul class="list-unstyled">
                   <li> We aimed to design a logo that would embody the calming and modern feel of our brand, using minimalist shapes and a single color. Our objective was to convey the key values of our brand, which are harmony and balance, through the logo. To achieve this, we chose simple shapes that would create a sense of balance, without necessarily being symmetrical. The logo reflects the idea that mothers need to find a balance between caring for their child and taking care of themselves, which is a recurring theme in our brand. We wanted this duality to be reflected in our logo as well, without being too literal.&nbsp; </li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
			
          <h6>Colour schemes&nbsp;</h6>
          <ul>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Primary colour #1:</strong> <em>— #5E70A2-</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
				<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color:#5E70A2;"></span>
              Our first primary colour is a deep, muted shade of blue commonly referred to as "steel blue". This particular shade is often associated with qualities such as professionalism, efficiency, and reliability. We chose this colour because it is not as harsh as other shades of blue and has a touch of purple, which is commonly associated with women and gives off a sense of calmness and stability.  
            </li>
		    </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                 <strong> Primary colour #2:</strong> <em>— #F2CC8F-</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
				<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color:#F2CC8F"></span>
              To create contrast we chose a bit more friendly and positive colour to match with the steel blue. This shade of light, muted yellow often associated with warmth, and positivity.  Additionally, blue’s complementary colour is yellow, so they create a pleasing visual effect.   
            </li>
		    </ul>
            </li>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Secondary colour #3</strong>: <em>— #FFFFFF-</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
				<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color:#FFFFFF"></span>
              Having white in our colour palette might seem a bit strange  but we felt that it's necessary to create balance and harmony between our two primary colours, which have a lot of contrast. By adding white as a neutral colour, we can achieve this goal. Additionally, we have learned that many luxury brands use white in their branding, and this could be an effective strategy for Leto to position itself better in the market.   
            </li>
		    </ul>
            </li>
			
			   <li>
                 <strong> Secondary colour #4:</strong> <em>— #717275-</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
				<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color:#717275"></span>
              Leto's website is heavily focused on maintaining consistency, which we achieved by dominantly using our two primary colours. We chose this specific shade of grey that has a cool and muted tone, which can be perceived as elegant and modern. This shade is dominantly used for our typefaces because it's easy to read.

          <h6>Font choices&nbsp;</h6>
          <ul>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Logo: </strong><em>— Goldoni</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
            Goldoni is a serif font that is frequently used in luxury branding because of its elegant and sophisticated design that creates a timeless and refined look. Its delicate curves and lines can convey an exclusive and luxurious experience that aligns with the values of high-end brands.&nbsp; </li>
		    </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                 <strong> Headlines and paragraphs:</strong> <em>— DM Sans</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
            As students, we use the DM Sans family of fonts for our headlines and paragraphs. This font has a clean and clear design with well-defined letterforms that make it easy to read on digital screens. Since our website has many visual elements, we wanted to balance it with a simpler typeface. The contemporary and modern design of DM Sans gives our website a fresh and up-to-date look, while its minimalist and clean design conveys a sense of professionalism and sophistication. To create hierarchy, we use various font weights to showcase headlines and paragraphs.&nbsp; </li>
		    </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>	
			
			
	      <h6>Supporting visuals&nbsp;</h6>
          <ul>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Graphics </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> We wanted to create a cohesive look for our website. To achieve this, we incorporated a wavy shape that is repeated throughout the pages. This shape matches the calm and smooth feeling that Leto embodies. We also used curvy elements in our logo, so it made sense to use the same curvy path for this visual as well. By using this consistent element, we were able to create a unified look for our website and brand.&nbsp; </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                 <strong> Animations </strong>
                 <ul class="list-unstyled">
                   <li> We used little animations to highlight our brand values in order to improve the user experience. Our landing page has an animated title that dynamically displays Leto's three ideals in a visually appealing and memorable manner. Furthermore, to encourage user involvement, we incorporated little interactive animations to each value in the "Values" section.&nbsp; </li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Icons </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> We designed a unique collection of icons to guarantee that Leto's aesthetic is constant and that the information given is user-friendly and clear. These symbols not only serve to break up long text blocks, but they also make the page more visually appealing and structured.&nbsp; </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
			
			 <h6>UI Elements&nbsp;</h6>
          <ul>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Navbar </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> The navigation bar is created with clear, easy-to-understand labels and a sans-serif typeface with a strong contrast against the backdrop to improve readability. It is positioned at the top of the page in a conventional position with a set location, making it easily accessible and consistent throughout the website. The bar includes interactive components that improve user feedback, such as a hover effect on the active page that gives the user clear feedback.&nbsp; </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                 <strong> Buttons </strong>
                 <ul class="list-unstyled">
                   <li> The buttons on the website are created to complement Leto's color scheme. When a user hovers over a button, the color of the button changes, giving the user clear that the element is clickable.&nbsp; </li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Cards </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> Throughout the website, a card design pattern is used to create a constant visual motif. These cards chunk information, making it easier for the user to read and assimilate..   </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                <strong> Dropdown </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> In desktop mode, the website has a dropdown menu in the navigation bar that allows visitors to select between reading team or brand information. This was developed in response to user input during prototype testing, which revealed that the existing navigation structure was too wide. The whole navigation bar becomes a dropdown menu on smaller displays, giving a less congested and more simplified mobile experience.&nbsp; </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Checkboxes </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> In the crowdfunding area, we employed the checkbox design pattern, which is an excellent technique to attract donations. Users may pick how much they wish to contribute without having to enter in a number by showing pre-selected quantities. This streamlines the procedure and removes the requirement for customers to choose their own donation amount.&nbsp; </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Progress bar </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> A progress indicator reflects the amount of money that has already been contributed to Leto in the crowdfunding area. This feature promotes brand confidence by indicating that others have contributed to the cause. It also displays a graphical picture of how near Leto is to meeting its fundraising target.&nbsp; </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                <strong> Form </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> The contribution form is intended to be simple and easy to use. We attempted to streamline the procedure as much as possible because we recognize that this is a critical point at which users may opt to leave the site if the form is too long or complex to complete.&nbsp; </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Pop up </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> Implementing the pop-up window in the crowdfunding area improved the user experience by giving the user clear feedback on the success or failure of their efforts. This element is crucial in expressing the consequence of the user's activities. &nbsp; </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <strong> Structure:</strong>
                 <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              Our initial plan was to create a parallax website with a single page, where users could navigate using either scrolling or with the navigation bar. We opted for a one-pager design to focus the user's attention on a single topic and enhance their mobile experience by eliminating the need to click on links or tabs. However, we later decided to move the fundraising section to a separate page to avoid coming across as overly pushy in soliciting donations, which wouldn't align with Leto's premium brand image.  

              In our first prototype, the order of the content was assembled differently. After our landing page we had our vision and mission plus value statements, and then the description of our service. We decided to change that since it was confusing to the user, and It didn’t make sense to ask for support at the beginning without showing the service we are raising for.   
            </li>
		   </ul>
          </li>
       </ul>
			
			<h6>Content&nbsp;</h6>
          <ul>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Landing page/ Hero section  </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> The homepage features a striking hero image that immediately captures the user's attention and sets the tone for the rest of the site. The animated header adds a touch of sophistication without being too overwhelming, as we wanted to maintain a calm and modern atmosphere that reflects Leto's high-end image. A video component would have been inappropriate for this design approach. 

				  A call-to-action button is also implemented in the landing page, which is clearly communicate the purpose of the page, helps the user to navigate easier on the website and encourage the user to support the brand.    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                 <strong> Our service </strong>
                 <ul class="list-unstyled">
                   <li> We implemented a 3-column grid system to organize information of our service. These grids are particularly effective at maintaining clarity and organization, especially when the information is long and a bit more complex Additionally, the grid system adds a sense of consistency to the website's appearance, as it is applied consistently throughout the site.  website. 

					The use of pictures in combination with the service description enhances user engagement and makes the information more digestible.  When the user hovers over an image, the zoom effect draws their attention and encourages them to interact with the content. The interactive nature of this effect helps to make the website feel more dynamic and interesting, which can improve user satisfaction and increase the time spent on the 

					Following the brief descriptions, a button is included for users who wish to access further information. This design choice allows this section to function as a teaser, arousing the user's curiosity and encouraging them to learn more. By clicking the button, users can delve deeper into the content and even contribute to Leto by donating.   </li>

                <strong> Vision and Mission  </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> To emphasize the essence of Leto, we employed the same shape as we discussed in supporting visuals in a different manner. Our layout features two complementary columns, which symbolize balance and harmony, imparting a clear understanding of Leto's core vision and mission.  </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> In this section, we utilized the 3-grid system once again to present a larger amount of text. To make the content more visually appealing and interactive for users, we combined the grid system with icons and little animations. This approach created a more engaging user experience and helped to convey the information in an effective and memorable way.   </li>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> This section serves two important purposes. Firstly, encouraging users to subscribe to the newsletter is an effective way to establish and maintain a positive relationship with customers. Secondly, from a visual standpoint, this section plays a crucial role in breaking up the vibrant coloured backgrounds and graphic elements by incorporating a photograph. This design choice ensures that the overall aesthetic remains visually appealing and doesn't become overwhelming to the eyes.  </li>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> The final section is dedicated to showcasing the team behind Leto. This approach is effective in establishing a personal connection between the brand and the users, as it provides insight into who we are as a team. However, we opted to place this section at the end of the website, as we believe that it is not the most critical element that we want to emphasize to users.   </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                <strong> Support us Page </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> The most critical page of the website is the crowdfunding section, as it serves the purpose of raising money. However, it was important to maintain Leto's style consistency while presenting this section, as we didn't want to be too pushy. The initial part of the page provides information about the service, as we believe that it is essential to be transparent about why we are asking for donations. We chose to use a timline or journey from to chunk the information in smaller pieces which ends and points to the crowdfunding section.&nbsp; &nbsp;The crowdfunding box follows, which includes preselected amounts with checkboxes to simplify the donation process, as previously discussed. The progress bar and donation form have also been discussed in the UI element section. We added a pop-up window to the website that appears when the user fills out the donation form and clicks on the submit button. This pop-up serves as a feedback confirmation to the user that their donation was successful and was received by Leto. 

Finally, at the bottom of the page, there is a graphical element of a bus that says, "Leto is coming soon," which is a friendly visual representation of the campaign's progress that aligns with Leto's style guidelines.</li>

	  <p><strong>Website testing</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>Goal</strong> &nbsp; -   to evaluate and improve the performance, usability, and user experience of a website</li>
            <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;identifying any issues or problems that users may encounter</li>
            
<li> <strong>Method</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>young adults and Mothers with youg children</li>
            <li> We presented our website to the target audience to assess whether they understood the service and brand and if the navigation of the website is easy for them. These sessions primarily focused on clarifying the website's content, and we found them to be very helpful in identifying necessary changes. We aimed to gather a larger sample size in order to gain more insight into the website's usability and potential errors. Therefore, we expanded the pool of possible participants, as a larger sample size would be more beneficial in achieving our research objectives. &nbsp;</li>
			<li> Setting: Online with the targte audience,  On campus with young adults</li>
            <li>Task is to donate 10 euros , get to know the brand, and get to know the service</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
				  
            <li><strong>Results</strong>, 5 E's:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Effective</strong>: Did the users manage to complete the tasks?&nbsp;</li>
                <li class="list-unstyled">Yes, they were all successful. </li>
				  
				  <li><strong>Efficient</strong>:Were the tasks accomplished in a short time? Could that be shorter?&nbsp;</li>
                <li class="list-unstyled"> The process of donating could be improved.&nbsp; </li>
				  
				   <li><strong>Easy to learn</strong>: Is it easy for users to remember the flow and learn the functions?&nbsp;</li>
                <li class="list-unstyled">Thanks to the clear navigation on the main page, they were able to use it confidently. However, one user thought that all the links in the navigation bar would take her to a different page.&nbsp; </li>
				  
				  <li><strong>Error Tolerant</strong>:Can errors be easily fixed? Does the software help fix them?&nbsp;</li>
                <li class="list-unstyled"> In case of misclicking on the navigation bar, the user can easily fix it by scrolling on the main page. Furthermore, the newsletter form is designed to reject email addresses that do not contain the "@" symbol, which helps users to avoid typos in their email addresses.&nbsp;</li>
				  
				  <li><strong>Engaging</strong>:Was the interface engaging / attractive, or did it turn users away from the website??&nbsp;</li>
                <li class="list-unstyled"> Was the interface engaging / attractive, or did it turn users away from the website?&nbsp;</li>
                  <li class="list-unstyled">All the testers appreciated the visual layout of the website. The colors and graphics used on the site helped them to become more engaged with it. Additionally, small details such as the hover zooming and flipping headlines made their experience enjoyable and captivating.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>

            </li>
			
          </ul>
			
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Improvements </strong></li>
				 
				
				<li><strong>Supporrt us&nbsp;</strong>: &nbsp;</li>
				<li class="list-unstyled">During testing, we discovered a major issue where visitors to our site who wanted to donate would click on the "Support Us" button in the hero section, but the link would take them to the top of the funding page, which contained a detailed description of our service rather than the crowdfunding section ( because they are on the same page) . To address this, we have temporarily changed the button's link to jump directly to the crowdfunding section when clicked, and only when visitors click "Get to Know More" will they be taken to the detailed description. If we had more time, we would consider modifying the flow by either integrating the donation section into the main page or creating a separate page for the detailed service and crowdfunding.&nbsp; </li>
				
		    	<li><strong>The team&nbsp;</strong>: &nbsp;</li>
				<li class="list-unstyled">We also encountered a minor issue where clicking on the team section would cause the page to scroll slightly past the section, resulting in the top portion being cut off. However, we were able to resolve this problem.&nbsp; </li>
					
					<li><strong>Navigtaion bar&nbsp;</strong>: &nbsp;</li>
				<li class="list-unstyled">Regarding the navigation bar, we may need to clarify to users that it will scroll them down the page rather than redirecting them to another page. While people generally appreciate the convenience of having all the content on one page that can be scrolled through, the navigation bar may give the impression of a different navigation flow.&nbsp; </li>
					
					 <li><strong>Titles</strong>: &nbsp;</li>
				<li class="list-unstyled">  Insights gained from the solution interviews revealed that the biggest complaint about the website's content was the lack of headings and titles in the detailed descriptions of the services provided so it was hard to read, but the target audience appriected the detailed desciption.As a result, we incorporated headings into each card to improve the overall readability and structure of the content.</li>
					
					<li><strong>Info about the nannies</strong>: &nbsp;</li>
				<li class="list-unstyled">  While testing with our target audience, we received feedback suggesting that adding a section dedicated to the nannies who work for Leto, along with some pictures and information, could further increase the appeal of using Leto's services. If we would continue the project we would implement this section. </li>
					
					<li><strong>Safari Error</strong>: &nbsp;</li>
				<li class="list-unstyled">  During testing, it was discovered that certain features of the website do not function correctly when accessed through Safari, and not trough Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. Errors were observed with the small animations in the hero section, as well as with the values. Despite efforts to identify the cause of the problem, the issue could not be resolved due to time constraints. </li>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p><strong>Reach:&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p>We intend to reach 70 people from our target group on Instagram over the course of a month. This will be done through the use of targeted Instagram stories and the publication of engaging content on our Instagram page, such as the portrayal of parents juggling the duties of being a lady and a mother. We'll assess our progress on a weekly basis to make sure we're on track. By April 14th, we hope to have 70 individuals following us on Instagram. &nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Affect and response:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Our major objective in meeting the needs of busy parents is to make customers feel relaxed and happy in the knowledge that they can effectively manage their lives as women and mothers. These emotions may be elicited by developing an emotional connection with the target audience and presenting the service as a useful and trustworthy resource. Customers, in particular, should be relieved to know that they are not alone in dealing with the stress and exhaustion of managing both their personal and familial life. Customers should be able to focus on their own requirements without worrying about their children's well-being if the service is reliable and trustworthy. &nbsp;</p>
          <p> Finally, our service should enable consumers to reclaim control of their life and begin working toward their personal and professional goals. These feelings are critical in establishing a strong emotional connection with the target audience, fostering customer loyalty, and enhancing the service's reputation as a reliable resource.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our major goal as a service provider for working mothers is to encourage the target market to use our services in order to help them prioritize self-care and maintain a good work-life balance. We want our consumers to: &nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>1. Website clicks: </strong>Our main goal with the campaign is to generate<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;click and visits on our crowdfunding website, specially from our target audience in Europe. By 14th of April we want to have 30 visits in our website.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>2. Likes</strong>: We want to create engaing content, and we can measure the engagement witht he number of likes on each post in comparission witht the&nbsp; number of the followers we have.&nbsp; By 14th of April we want to recieve 40 likes in total in Leto's instagram Page&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp; <strong>3. Shares: </strong>The most effiecent way to spread our message<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and to attract more possible cotumer. If our followers share a post, we can see that the post is relaitable and engaging for our target audience. By 14th of April we want to have 5 shares on any post of Leto.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>To achieve these goals, we will structure our messaging to stress the benefits of our service, such as trustworthy and reputable childcare assistance and the gift of time for busy women to focus on their own goals. We will distribute our message using Instagram, which is popular among our target audience, and during times when they are most likely to be online, such as early in the morning and late at night. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Finally, we want the target sudience to use our services and highlight their personal well-being by providing trustworthy and respectable childcare assistance. By properly presenting our message and participating across well-known social media sites, we can help busy mothers save time, reduce stress, discover balance, raise happiness, and improve overall wellbeing. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Target audience:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Our target audience consists of busy mothers who are juggling their personal lives with their obligations as parents, particularly mothers. They want to be able to care for their children while also taking care of themselves.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>When it comes to media, they are likely to use social media sites such as Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest to stay in touch with friends and family, as well as to get knowledge and inspiration about parenting, lifestyle, and self-care. They may also seek advice and support from other mothers through internet forums and blogs. In this approach, we are primarily focused on Instagram, as it is the world's largest social media platform with comprehensive parenting and motherhood information&nbsp;</p>
          <p>They generally don't spend much time on social media since they are so busy, but they will check in throughout the day when they get a chance. They may be more active when their children are sleeping or after they have gone to bed. When they have free time, they may look at the topic for a few hours. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>In terms of other brands, they're probably interested in products and services that cater to their busy lifestyle and help them save time. For example, meal delivery services, cleaning services, and personal care products.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>To address this audience, we emphasize how our service may assist them in balancing personal and parenting duties, as well as the convenience and quality of your services. So we want to share material when they are most likely to be engaged on social media. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>These women are likely to be at ease using technology and the internet to get information and connect with others, but they also value face-to-face relationships and may seek out chances to connect with other mothers in their neighborhood.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>To position our message, we focus on communicating how our service can help busy mothers take care of their children while also having time for themselves. We want to emphasize the convenience, quality, and reliability of your service, as well as any unique benefits that we set apart from our competitors.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Some potential key messages might include:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- "Take care of your children and yourself with our trusted service"&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- "Say goodbye to stress and hello to free time with our reliable childcare service"&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- "Simplify your life and prioritize self-care with our convenient childcare solution"&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- "Let us help you balance motherhood and personal time with our high-quality childcare service"</p>
          <p>In addition to these key messages, we also consider highlighting any specific features or benefits of your service that are particularly important to your target audience. For example, we might emphasize the flexibility of your service, the experience and qualifications of your caregivers, or the ease of scheduling and payment.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Ultimately, the goal of our messaging should be to position our service as a valuable solution for busy mothers who are looking for a reliable, convenient, and high-quality childcare option that allows them to prioritize their own self-care and personal time. &nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Media Tactics:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Instagram is a perfect social media tool for our target demographic of busy mothers searching for information and inspiration on the go. Instagram is a visually rich platform that allows users to effortlessly interact and communicate with others through photographs and videos, making it a great tool for advertising our services and creating a feeling of community among our target demographic. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>With Instagram as our primary social media channel, we can interact with our target audience on a more intimate and relevant level while effectively communicating our message. The ability to publish visual material, hashtags to reach a larger audience, and tools like Instagram Stories  to showcase our services and engage with our audience in a more original and creative way are just a few of Instagram's distinctive capabilities. We can accomplish our goals of marketing our services, creating a feeling of community, and enabling busy women to prioritize their own care by using Instagram as our primary social media platform. Because of its distinctive advantages, Instagram is a powerful instrument for connecting with our target market and creatively and attractively demonstrating the value of our services. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>In order to make the most of Instagram, we would design an engaging Instagram profile that showcases the advantages of our services and speaks to the demands of our target market. By regularly releasing useful, instructive, and motivating content with inspiring pictures, we would connect with our followers and use pertinent hashtags such as #mom #motherhood #love #childcare #mother #brand etc to reach a larger audience. We would also use Instagram Stories to promote our service and establish a more personal connection with our audience by posting our brand design work and interesting poems about mother and childcare. &nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Planning:&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <img src="images/corporate/calendar-1.jpg" width="400" alt="Planning 1">
			<img src="images/corporate/calendar-2.jpg" width="400" alt="Planning 2">
		  <p>According to our planning, we'll distribute stuff such as images of motivational content with related hashtags on Instagram Stories. In the meanwhile, we'll follow brands that are similar to ours to grow our fan base. &nbsp;</p>
		  <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p> Throughout the project, we gained valuable insights into our communication and media plan. We discovered that Instagram was a great platform for reaching our target audience, as it allowed us to use visual content, hashtags, and Instagram Stories/Reels to engage with them. However, we found that business mode had mixed results, and we learned that we need to be more specific with our content and business management style in the future.</p>
          <p>Our reach objective was to get 70 followers by the end of the project. We currently have 50 followers which we consider a success, since we were not sponsoring our page with paid ads or influencer promotions.&nbsp; We believe these could improve the reach, but overall we are satisfied with the results.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We aimed to get 30 visits to our website,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and we were sucessful to reach this objective, thanks to our engaging campaing.</p>
          <p>We got 45 likes which is decent during the campaing but we feel we could improve the engagement level to recieve commnts as well.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>For the objective to get shares, the campaign failed, no shares were recieved by our followers, so we need to work on this, maybe with including giveaways or somekind of games which includes sharing the content.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Google Analytic</strong>&nbsp;:</p>
		  <img src="images/corporate/google-report.jpg" width="900" alt="report">
          <p>Based on the Google Analytics report, it seems that the Instagram campaign is successfully reaching its target audience. A majority of visitors are coming from Organic Social, which includes Instagram, and Facebook. Additionally, the primary campaign is on Instagram, which means that it is likely driving a significant amount of traffic to the website. The engagement time of 2 minutes and 6 seconds is a positive sign, as it indicates that visitors are finding the content interesting and are spending time on the website.

		  It is also clear from the report that the target audience is primarily located in Europe, with the Netherlands and Hungary being the most significant markets. However, there are also visitors from other parts of the world, including the US and the UK.

		  The fact that the most commonly used browser to view the website is Chrome is also worth noting. This information can help the brand optimize its website for this particular browser to provide the best user experience possible.</p>
          <p><strong>Major learning points</strong>&nbsp;:</p>
          <p>One of the most significant things we took away from this experience was the need of consistency and providing our audience with quality material. We were able to establish ourselves as a trustworthy source of information by consistently offering pertinent and useful content. We also came to the realization that adaptability and flexibility were crucial since we needed to pay attention to audience comments and modify our plan as necessary. We discovered that this is the case since, thanks to our Instagram posting management, we get a larger audience than those who watch our Instagram stories. Hashtags on Instagram allowed users to access a wider audience and those working for related companies. The Instagram postings and hashtags were the primary sources of our followers which is the more effective method to reach out to target groups.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;Moving forward, we plan to focus on building deeper relationships with our audience and providing more personalized services that meet their needs. We will continue to use Instagram as our main social media platform and invest in paid advertising to increase brand awareness. We would like to use influencers marketing method to engage with more future clients and audiences, in this way, we must invest more energy and finance on the marketing. </p>
          <p>Additionally, we'll place a high priority on establishing enduring connections with influencers that share our values and complement our brand. As a result of our experience, we can say that good communication and media strategy need constant adaptability, flexibility, and a readiness to engage with and learn from our audience. &nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>&nbsp;We have identified numerous areas where we may enhance and optimize our communication and media plan after considering how we have previously carried out our strategy and assessing our outcomes. If the project were to go forward, we would suggest the following:</p>
          <p>-<strong>Reassess our target audience:</strong> To better understand our target audience and make sure we are properly reaching them; we would do more research. This would entail, if required, constructing a new identity as well as crafting message and content that speaks to their wants and needs.</p>
          <p><strong>&nbsp;- Develop a detailed content calendar</strong>: Create a thorough content calendar that explains content plan for the forthcoming time period based on your expertise and observations. This would guarantee that we consistently communicate with our audience and offer value to them. </p>
          <p><strong>- Make the most of Instagram:</strong> We would keep using Instagram as our primary social media tool, but we would also investigate additional features and chances to interact with our followers. This can entail leveraging Reels, IGTV, and Instagram Live to deliver interesting and educational material.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>-Invest in influencer marketing strategically:</strong> We would begin using this marketing strategy, be selective in the influencers we choose, and concentrate on establishing long-term connections with people who share our brand values. To assure the success of influencer programs, we would also set clear objectives and KPIs.</p>
          <p><strong>-Use paid advertising strategically</strong>: In order to ensure that our ads are seen by the correct people, we would continue to spend in paid advertising while focusing on a few key demographics and interests. Additionally, we would keep a careful eye on our outcomes and revise our plan as necessary. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>In general, we would approach future planning with an emphasis on giving our audience value and creating lasting connections. Prioritizing consistency and high-quality content, we would spend money on tried-and-true marketing techniques. To make sure we are fulfilling the requirements of our target audience and reaching our goals, we would also be open to testing and change as necessary.&nbsp;</p>

          </ul>
		  <p>We want to establish a connection with our target audience, women who struggle to juggle their personal life with parental obligations, by sharing relevant and endearing pictures of mothers and kids on our Instagram account. These pictures enable us to convey to our audience that we are sensitive to their wants and that we are ready to assist them in their parenting endeavours. </p>
		  <p>Additionally, by showcasing our service in action through photographs and illustrations, we can provide a glimpse into what we offer and demonstrate the quality of care that we provide. This can help build trust and credibility with potential customers who may be hesitant to entrust their children with a new childcare provider.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>Furthermore, we understand that Instagram is a visual platform, therefore it's critical to upload attention-grabbing and aesthetically pleasing material in order to stand out and get people' attention. We can build a visually appealing and engaging feed that stands out from the competition by carefully choosing and curating photographs that are consistent with our brand values and appeal to our target audience.</p>
			<p>Our Instagram account is essential to the communication and marketing plan for our brand. We want to establish a solid and devoted following on the platform in order to eventually draw in more clients for our service. To do this, we showcase our services in action, share relevant, touching pictures of moms and children, and provide visually engaging material. &nbsp;</p>

          <h4 id="management-4" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>In creating our brand, we considered several factors, such as our target audience, brand values, and competitive landscape, to create a brand that would resonate with our customers and stand out in a crowded market.We started by conducting market research to gain insights into our target audience's needs, preferences, and pain points. We then developed our brand values, which are centered around providing balance in mothers life with high-quality, personalized, and trustworthy care services.</p>
          <p>The existing alternatives in the nanny agency market are focused on affordability and accessibility, with anyone being able to apply for a job ( for example <a href="https://www.bebiszitterkereso.hu/" class="corporate-links">this one</a>, or <a href="https://en.babysits.nl/landing/babysitters/?utm_campaign=search-nl-parents&gclid=CjwKCAjwrdmhBhBBEiwA4Hx5g41aXYCtr5aHempAmhBMxcjOClWBtBrfVY09i_vJesF_6C3yM_jFDRoCy28QAvD_BwE" class="corporate-links">this one</a>). However, our brand, Leto, differentiates itself by focusing on providing highly experienced and professional nannies who offer more than just childcare services. We prioritize the needs of both the mother and the child, providing help with household chores as well as childcare, making our services more comprehensive and valuable to busy working mothers. Our focus on professionalism and expertise allows us to provide a superior level of care, giving parents peace of mind knowing that their children are in safe hands. We also understand that a nanny's role is not just to provide supervision but also to foster positive relationships with both the children and the parents. That's why we emphasize the importance of communication skills, engaging and educational activities, good time-management and organizational skills, and flexibility when selecting our nannies. Overall, by focusing on professionalism, expertise, and comprehensive services, we believe that Leto can set itself apart from the competition and attract customers who value high-quality care and exceptional service.&nbsp;</p>

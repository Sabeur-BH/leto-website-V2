          <ul>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Brand name:</strong> <em>— Leto</em>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              We chose the name Leto, because it is short, easy to remember and sounds smooth and feminine. It refers to the ancient god names Leto, who is the goddess of motherhood, which also align with our brand vision and mission.  
            </li>
		    </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                 <strong> Brand Logo: </strong>
                 <ul class="list-unstyled">
                   <li> Our goal was to create a logo that is not too literal, but rather abstract with minimalist shapes and a single colour that complements the calming and modern feel we are aiming for with the brand. We wanted the logo to symbolize the key values of our brand, which are harmony and balance. To achieve this, we opted for simple shapes that would create a sense of balance without being symmetrical. The logo reflects the idea that mothers need to find a way to be there for their child while also taking care of themselves. This duality is a recurring theme in our brand, and we wanted it to be reflected in our logo as well. </li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
			
          <h6>Colour schemes&nbsp;</h6>
          <ul>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Primary colour #1:</strong> <em>— #5E70A2-</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
				<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color:#5E70A2;"></span>
              Our first primary colour is a deep, muted shade of blue commonly referred to as "steel blue". This particular shade is often associated with qualities such as professionalism, efficiency, and reliability. We chose this colour because it is not as harsh as other shades of blue and has a touch of purple, which is commonly associated with women and gives off a sense of calmness and stability.  
            </li>
		    </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                 <strong> Primary colour #2:</strong> <em>— #F2CC8F-</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
				<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color:#F2CC8F"></span>
              To create contrast we chose a bit more friendly and positive colour to match with the steel blue. This shade of light, muted yellow often associated with warmth, and positivity.  Additionally, blue’s complementary colour is yellow, so they create a pleasing visual effect.   
            </li>
		    </ul>
            </li>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Primary colour #3</strong>: <em>— #FFFFFF-</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
				<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color:#FFFFFF"></span>
              Having white in our colour palette might seem a bit strange and boring but we understand that it's necessary to create balance and harmony between our two primary colours, which have a lot of contrast. By adding white as a neutral colour, we can achieve this goal. Additionally, we have learned that many luxury brands use white in their branding, and this could be an effective strategy for Leto to position itself better in the market.   
            </li>
		    </ul>
            </li>
			
			   <li>
                 <strong> Secondary colour #4:</strong> <em>— #717275-</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
				<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color:#717275"></span>
              Leto's website is heavily focused on maintaining consistency, which we achieved by dominantly using our three primary colours. We chose this specific shade of grey that has a cool and muted tone, which can be perceived as elegant and modern. This shade is dominantly used for our typefaces because it's easy to read.    
            </li>

          <h6>Font choices&nbsp;</h6>
          <ul>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Logo: </strong><em>— Goldoni</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              Goldoni is a serif font that is often used in luxury branding, and it is a suitable choice for a logo. It’s elegant and sophisticated design creates a timeless and refined look that can enhance a brand's image. Its delicate curves and lines can convey a sense of luxury and exclusivity that aligns with a high-end brand's values.  
            </li>
		    </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                 <strong> Headlines and paragraphs:</strong> <em>— DM Sans</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              For the headlines and paragraphs, we use the DM Sans family of fonts. This font has a clean and clear design with well-defined letterforms that make it easy to read on digital screens. Since there are many visual elements on the website, we wanted to balance it with a simpler typeface. The contemporary and modern design of DM Sans gives the website a fresh and up-to-date look, while its minimalist and clean design conveys a sense of professionalism and sophistication. To create hierarchy, we use various font weights to showcase headlines and paragraphs.    
            </li>
		    </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>	
			
			
	      <h6>Supporting visuals&nbsp;</h6>
          <ul>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Graphics </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> We make use of one specific shape on the website, which reoccurs many times, and which helps to build a comprehensive look to all the pages. This wavey shape also match with the feeling of Leto, calm and smooth. The logo has curvy elements, this is why we ended up using the same curvy path to this visual as well. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                 <strong> Animations </strong>
                 <ul class="list-unstyled">
                   <li> In order to enhance the user experience, we utilized little animations to promote our brand values. Our landing page features an animated headline that dynamically showcases the three values of Leto in a visually appealing and memorable way. Moreover, we added small interactive animations to each value in the "Values" to encourage user engagement. </li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Icons </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> To ensure that Leto's style remains consistent, and that the information presented is user-friendly and easily understandable, we created a unique set of icons. These icons not only help to break up lengthy text blocks, but they also make the website more organized and visually attractive. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
			
			 <h6>UI Elements&nbsp;</h6>
          <ul>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Navbar </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> The navigation bar is designed with clear labels that are easy to understand, using sans-serif typeface with a high contrast against the background, which enhances readability. It is placed in a standard position at the top of the page, using a fixed position, making it easily accessible and consistent throughout the website. The bar incorporates interactive elements that enhance user feedback, with a hover effect on the active page, which provides clear feedback to the user.  </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                 <strong> Buttons </strong>
                 <ul class="list-unstyled">
                   <li> The website's buttons are designed to align with Leto's colour scheme. When a user hovers over a button, the colour of the button changes, providing clear feedback to the user that it is a clickable element.  </li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Cards </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> The website utilizes a card design pattern throughout, creating a consistent visual theme. These cards serve to chunk information, making it more easily readable and digestible for the user.   </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                <strong> Dropdown </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> In desktop mode, the website features a dropdown menu in the navigation bar that allows users to choose between viewing information about the team or the brand. This was implemented based on feedback from prototype testing, where users found the previous navigation structure too broad. In smaller screens, the entire navigation bar becomes a dropdown menu, creating a less crowded and more streamlined mobile experience.  </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Checkboxes </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> We used the checkbox design pattern in the crowdfunding section, which is an effective way to encourage donations. By presenting preselected amounts, it's easy for users to choose how much they want to donate without having to type in an amount. This simplifies the process and eliminates the need for users to decide on their own donation amount.   </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Progress bar </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> The crowdfunding section includes a progress bar that displays the amount of money that has already been donated to Leto. This feature helps to build trust in the brand by demonstrating that others have contributed to the cause. Additionally, it provides a visual representation of how close Leto is to reaching its fundraising goal.  </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                <strong> Form </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> The donation form is designed to be user-friendly and straightforward. We aimed to simplify the process as much as possible because we understand that this is a crucial moment where users may choose to abandon the site if the form is too lengthy or complicated to fill out.   </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Pop up </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> Implementing the pop-up window in the crowdfunding section has enhanced the user experience by providing clear feedback to the user about the success or failure of their actions. This element holds great importance in conveying the outcome of the user's actions.&nbsp; </li>
                </ul>
            </li>  
         </ul>
			
		<h6>Navigation&nbsp;</h6>
          <ul>
			  <li>
                <strong> Structure:</strong>
                 <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              Our initial plan was to create a parallax website with a single page, where users could navigate using either scrolling or with the navigation bar. We opted for a one-pager design to focus the user's attention on a single topic and enhance their mobile experience by eliminating the need to click on links or tabs. However, we later decided to move the fundraising section to a separate page to avoid coming across as overly pushy in soliciting donations, which wouldn't align with Leto's premium brand image.  

              In our first prototype, the order of the content was assembled differently. After our landing page we had our vision and mission plus value statements, and then the description of our service. We decided to change that since it was confusing to the user, and It didn’t make sense to ask for support at the beginning without showing the service we are raising for.   
            </li>
		   </ul>
          </li>
       </ul>
			
			<h6>Content&nbsp;</h6>
          <ul>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Landing page/ Hero section  </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> The homepage features a striking hero image that immediately captures the user's attention and sets the tone for the rest of the site. The animated header adds a touch of sophistication without being too overwhelming, as we wanted to maintain a calm and modern atmosphere that reflects Leto's high-end image. A video component would have been inappropriate for this design approach. 

				  A call-to-action button is also implemented in the landing page, which is clearly communicate the purpose of the page, helps the user to navigate easier on the website and encourage the user to support the brand.    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                 <strong> Our service </strong>
                 <ul class="list-unstyled">
                   <li> We implemented a 3-column grid system to organize information of our service. These grids are particularly effective at maintaining clarity and organization, especially when the information is long and a bit more complex Additionally, the grid system adds a sense of consistency to the website's appearance, as it is applied consistently throughout the site.  website. 

					The use of pictures in combination with the service description enhances user engagement and makes the information more digestible.  When the user hovers over an image, the zoom effect draws their attention and encourages them to interact with the content. The interactive nature of this effect helps to make the website feel more dynamic and interesting, which can improve user satisfaction and increase the time spent on the 

					Following the brief descriptions, a button is included for users who wish to access further information. This design choice allows this section to function as a teaser, arousing the user's curiosity and encouraging them to learn more. By clicking the button, users can delve deeper into the content and even contribute to Leto by donating.   </li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
			  
			  <li>
                <strong> Vision and Mission  </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> To emphasize the essence of Leto, we employed the same shape as we discussed in supporting visuals in a different manner. Our layout features two complementary columns, which symbolize balance and harmony, imparting a clear understanding of Leto's core vision and mission.  </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                <strong> Values </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> In this section, we utilized the 3-grid system once again to present a larger amount of text. To make the content more visually appealing and interactive for users, we combined the grid system with icons and little animations. This approach created a more engaging user experience and helped to convey the information in an effective and memorable way.   </li>

            </li>

                <strong> Newsletter </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> This section serves two important purposes. Firstly, encouraging users to subscribe to the newsletter is an effective way to establish and maintain a positive relationship with customers. Secondly, from a visual standpoint, this section plays a crucial role in breaking up the vibrant coloured backgrounds and graphic elements by incorporating a photograph. This design choice ensures that the overall aesthetic remains visually appealing and doesn't become overwhelming to the eyes.  </li>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> The final section is dedicated to showcasing the team behind Leto. This approach is effective in establishing a personal connection between the brand and the users, as it provides insight into who we are as a team. However, we opted to place this section at the end of the website, as we believe that it is not the most critical element that we want to emphasize to users.   </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			  
			   <li>
                <strong> Support us Page </strong>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li> The most critical page of the website is the crowdfunding section, as it serves the purpose of raising money. However, it was important to maintain Leto's style consistency while presenting this section, as we didn't want to be too pushy. The initial part of the page provides information about the service, as we believe that it is essential to be transparent about why we are asking for donations. We chose to use a timline or journey from to chunk the information in smaller pieces which ends and points to the crowdfunding section.&nbsp; &nbsp;The crowdfunding box follows, which includes preselected amounts with checkboxes to simplify the donation process, as previously discussed. The progress bar and donation form have also been discussed in the UI element section. We added a pop-up window to the website that appears when the user fills out the donation form and clicks on the submit button. This pop-up serves as a feedback confirmation to the user that their donation was successful and was received by Leto. 

Finally, at the bottom of the page, there is a graphical element of a bus that says, "Leto is coming soon," which is a friendly visual representation of the campaign's progress that aligns with Leto's style guidelines.</li>

To address this, we have temporarily changed the button's link to jump directly to the crowdfunding section when clicked, and only when visitors click "Get to Know More" will they be taken to the detailed description. If we had more time, we would consider modifying the flow by either integrating the donation section into the main page or creating a separate page for the detailed service and crowdfunding.&nbsp; </li>

				<li class="list-unstyled">Regarding the navigation bar, we may need to clarify to users that it will scroll them down the page rather than redirecting them to another page.

          <p><strong>Target audience:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Our target audience is made up of busy mothers who are struggling to balance their personal life with their responsibilities as a parent, especially mothers. They're looking for a way to take care of their children while also having time for themselves.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>When it comes to media, they're likely to use social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest to stay connected with friends and family, find information and inspiration about parenting, lifestyle, and self-care. They may also use online forums and blogs to seek advice and support from other mothers. In this way, we are mainly focusing on Instagram, as this is the biggest social media in the world with full reachable content of parenting and motherhood.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Since they're so busy, they probably don't spend a lot of time on social media but will check in throughout the day when they have a chance. They may be more active during downtime, like when their children are napping or after they've gone to bed. They might look into those content for few hours in a day when they have spare time.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In terms of other brands, they're probably interested in products and services that cater to their busy lifestyle and help them save time. For example, meal delivery services, cleaning services, and personal care products.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>To reach this audience, we emphasize how our service can help them balance their personal and parental responsibilities and highlight the convenience and quality of your services. So we want to post content during peak times when they're most likely to be active on social media.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>These mothers are probably comfortable using technology and the internet to find information and connect with others, but they also value face-to-face interactions and may seek out opportunities to connect with other mothers in their community.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>To position our message, we focus on communicating how our service can help busy mothers take care of their children while also having time for themselves. We want to emphasize the convenience, quality, and reliability of your service, as well as any unique benefits that we set apart from our competitors.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Some potential key messages might include:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- "Take care of your children and yourself with our trusted service"&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- "Say goodbye to stress and hello to free time with our reliable childcare service"&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- "Simplify your life and prioritize self-care with our convenient childcare solution"&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- "Let us help you balance motherhood and personal time with our high-quality childcare service"</p>
          <p>In addition to these key messages, we also consider highlighting any specific features or benefits of your service that are particularly important to your target audience. For example, we might emphasize the flexibility of your service, the experience and qualifications of your caregivers, or the ease of scheduling and payment.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Ultimately, the goal of our messaging should be to position our service as a valuable solution for busy mothers who are looking for a reliable, convenient, and high-quality childcare option that allows them to prioritize their own self-care and personal time. &nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Media Tactics:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Instagram is an ideal social media platform for our target audience of busy mothers who are looking for quick and easy access to information and inspiration. Instagram is a highly visual platform that allows users to easily connect and engage with others through images and videos, making it an effective tool for promoting our services and building a sense of community among our target audience. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>With Instagram as our primary social media channel, we can interact with our target audience on a more intimate and relevant level while effectively communicating our message. The ability to publish visual material, hashtags to reach a larger audience, and tools like Instagram Stories and Reels to showcase our services and engage with our audience in a more original and creative way are just a few of Instagram's distinctive capabilities. We can accomplish our goals of marketing our services, creating a feeling of community, and enabling busy women to prioritize their own care by using Instagram as our primary social media platform. Because of its distinctive advantages, Instagram is a powerful instrument for connecting with our target market and creatively and attractively demonstrating the value of our services. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>In order to make the most of Instagram, we would design an engaging Instagram profile that showcases the advantages of our services and speaks to the demands of our target market. By regularly releasing useful, instructive, and motivating content with inspiring pictures, we would connect with our followers and use pertinent hashtags such as #mom #motherhood #love #childcare #mother #brand etc to reach a larger audience. We would also use Instagram Stories to promote our service and establish a more personal connection with our audience by posting our brand design work and interesting poems about mother and childcare. &nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Planning:&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <img src="images/corporate/calendar-1.jpg" width="400px" alt="Planning 1">
			<img src="images/corporate/calendar-2.jpg" width="400px" alt="Planning 2">
		  <p>According to our planning, we'll distribute stuff such as images of motivational content with related hashtags on Instagram Stories. In the meanwhile, we'll follow brands that are similar to ours to grow our fan base. &nbsp;</p>
		  <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p> Throughout the project, we gained valuable insights into our communication and media plan. We discovered that Instagram was a great platform for reaching our target audience, as it allowed us to use visual content, hashtags, and Instagram Stories/Reels to engage with them. However, we found that business mode had mixed results, and we learned that we need to be more specific with our content and business management style in the future.</p>
          <p><strong>Google Analytic</strong>&nbsp;:</p>
		  <img src="images/corporate/google-report.jpg" width="900px" alt="report">
          <p>Placeholder text</p>
          <p><strong>Major learning points</strong>&nbsp;:</p>
          <p>One of the most significant things we took away from this experience was the need of consistency and providing our audience with quality material. We were able to establish ourselves as a trustworthy source of information by consistently offering pertinent and useful content. We also came to the realization that adaptability and flexibility were crucial since we needed to pay attention to audience comments and modify our plan as necessary. We discovered that this is the case since, thanks to our Instagram posting management, we get a larger audience than those who watch our Instagram stories. Hashtags on Instagram allowed users to access a wider audience and those working for related companies. The Instagram postings and hashtags were the primary sources of our followers which is the more effective method to reach out to target groups.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;Moving forward, we plan to focus on building deeper relationships with our audience and providing more personalized services that meet their needs. We will continue to use Instagram as our main social media platform and invest in paid advertising to increase brand awareness. We would like to use influencers marketing method to engage with more future clients and audiences, in this way, we must invest more energy and finance on the marketing. </p>
          <p>Additionally, we'll place a high priority on establishing enduring connections with influencers that share our values and complement our brand. As a result of our experience, we can say that good communication and media strategy need constant adaptability, flexibility, and a readiness to engage with and learn from our audience. &nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>&nbsp;We have identified numerous areas where we may enhance and optimize our communication and media plan after considering how we have previously carried out our strategy and assessing our outcomes. If the project were to go forward, we would suggest the following:</p>
          <p>-<strong>Reassess our target audience:</strong> To better understand our target audience and make sure we are properly reaching them; we would do more research. This would entail, if required, constructing a new identity as well as crafting message and content that speaks to their wants and needs.</p>
          <p><strong>&nbsp;- Develop a detailed content calendar</strong>: Create a thorough content calendar that explains content plan for the forthcoming time period based on your expertise and observations. This would guarantee that we consistently communicate with our audience and offer value to them. </p>
          <p><strong>- Make the most of Instagram:</strong> We would keep using Instagram as our primary social media tool, but we would also investigate additional features and chances to interact with our followers. This can entail leveraging Reels, IGTV, and Instagram Live to deliver interesting and educational material.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>-Invest in influencer marketing strategically:</strong> We would begin using this marketing strategy, be selective in the influencers we choose, and concentrate on establishing long-term connections with people who share our brand values. To assure the success of influencer programs, we would also set clear objectives and KPIs.</p>
          <p><strong>-Use paid advertising strategically</strong>: In order to ensure that our ads are seen by the correct people, we would continue to spend in paid advertising while focusing on a few key demographics and interests. Additionally, we would keep a careful eye on our outcomes and revise our plan as necessary. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>In general, we would approach future planning with an emphasis on giving our audience value and creating lasting connections. Prioritizing consistency and high-quality content, we would spend money on tried-and-true marketing techniques. To make sure we are fulfilling the requirements of our target audience and reaching our goals, we would also be open to testing and change as necessary.&nbsp;</p>

		  <p>We want to establish a connection with our target audience, women who struggle to juggle their personal life with parental obligations, by sharing relevant and endearing pictures of mothers and kids on our Instagram account. These pictures enable us to convey to our audience that we are sensitive to their wants and that we are ready to assist them in their parenting endeavours. </p>
		  <p>Additionally, by showcasing our service in action through photographs and illustrations, we can provide a glimpse into what we offer and demonstrate the quality of care that we provide. This can help build trust and credibility with potential customers who may be hesitant to entrust their children with a new childcare provider.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>Furthermore, we understand that Instagram is a visual platform, therefore it's critical to upload attention-grabbing and aesthetically pleasing material in order to stand out and get people' attention. We can build a visually appealing and engaging feed that stands out from the competition by carefully choosing and curating photographs that are consistent with our brand values and appeal to our target audience.</p>
			<p>Our Instagram account is essential to the communication and marketing plan for our brand. We want to establish a solid and devoted following on the platform in order to eventually draw in more clients for our service. To do this, we showcase our services in action, share relevant, touching pictures of moms and children, and provide visually engaging material. &nbsp;</p>

          <h4 id="management-4" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>In creating our brand, we considered several factors, such as our target audience, brand values, and competitive landscape, to create a brand that would resonate with our customers and stand out in a crowded market.We started by conducting market research to gain insights into our target audience's needs, preferences, and pain points. We then developed our brand values, which are centered around providing balance in mothers life with high-quality, personalized, and trustworthy care services.</p>
          <p>The existing alternatives in the nanny agency market are focused on affordability and accessibility, with anyone being able to apply for a job ( for example <a href="https://www.bebiszitterkereso.hu/" class="corporate-links">this one</a>, or <a href="https://en.babysits.nl/landing/babysitters/?utm_campaign=search-nl-parents&gclid=CjwKCAjwrdmhBhBBEiwA4Hx5g41aXYCtr5aHempAmhBMxcjOClWBtBrfVY09i_vJesF_6C3yM_jFDRoCy28QAvD_BwE" class="corporate-links">this one</a>). However, our brand, Leto, differentiates itself by focusing on providing highly experienced and professional nannies who offer more than just childcare services. We prioritize the needs of both the mother and the child, providing help with household chores as well as childcare, making our services more comprehensive and valuable to busy working mothers. Our focus on professionalism and expertise allows us to provide a superior level of care, giving parents peace of mind knowing that their children are in safe hands. We also understand that a nanny's role is not just to provide supervision but also to foster positive relationships with both the children and the parents. That's why we emphasize the importance of communication skills, engaging and educational activities, good time-management and organizational skills, and flexibility when selecting our nannies. Overall, by focusing on professionalism, expertise, and comprehensive services, we believe that Leto can set itself apart from the competition and attract customers who value high-quality care and exceptional service.&nbsp;</p>
